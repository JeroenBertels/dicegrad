This repository accompanies our paper: Analyzing the gradients of the Dice loss in the context of missing or empty labels: Introducing $\Phi$ and $\epsilon$, which can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09521).
We have made use of the [DeepVoxNet2](https://github.com/JeroenBertels/deepvoxnet2) (DVN2) framework. A working Python environment with all necessary packages can be created easily by installing DVN2 through pip.

All the code for ACDC and BRATS can be found under the corresponding directories. In each directory, the ```howto.ipynb``` explains how the code is organized and how the results table, plots and figures of the paper can be obtained.

Thank you for your interest! :-)
